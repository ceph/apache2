  [ Stefan Fritsch ]
  * Move NameVirtualHost directive to ports.conf and switch from "*" to
    "*:80". (Closes: #314606, #486286)
  * Comment out the CacheEnable line in disk_cache.conf. It would have caused
    problems with Etch to Lenny upgrades.
  * Change the minimum user id for suexec back to 100, the new value of 1000
    was too disruptive for existing configurations. (Closes: #488821)
  * Add a default SSL virtual host. (Closes: #267477)
    - Use snakeoil certificate by default (if ssl-cert is installed).
      (Closes: #293524, #446765)
    - Document this in README.Debian.
      (Closes: #293469, #293519, #398520, #395823)
    - Add MSIE workarounds. (Closes: #421802)
    - Add ssl-cert to Recommends.
  * Add a new config file /etc/apache2/conf.d/security with some vaguely
    security related diectives. (Closes: #260063)
  * Adjust mod_userdir accordingly. Also add "AllowOverride Indexes" for the
    home directories.
  * Disable SSLv2 by default. It is insecure. Also only enable ciphers with
    key lengths of at least 128 bit.
  * Make the init script complain about a missing $APACHE_PID_FILE during
    "start", too, and not only during "stop" or "restart". This makes it more
    obvious that /etc/apache2/envvars has to be updated. (Closes: #473982)
  * Add hint about the "..., using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName" warning to
    README.Debian. (Closes: #457708)
  * Add hint about the "could not create rewrite_log_lock" error message to

  * Remove empty dir from apache2-doc to fix Lintian warning.
  * Always pass -g to gcc instead of relying on dpkg-buildpackage to set
    CFLAGS. We always want the debug info for the apache2-dbg package.

  [ Ryan Niebur ]
  * Upgraded to policy 3.8.0

apache2 (2.2.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the init script use normal 'stop' instead of 'graceful-stop' again:
    With graceful-stop, it can take a long time until all child processes have
    closed their listening sockets and there is no way for the init script to
    know when it is save to start apache again. This could make the restart of
    apache fail. (Closes: #486629, #463338)
  * Improve package descriptions, thanks to Justin B Rye. (Closes: #486855)

 -- Stefan Fritsch <sf@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Jun 2008 12:22:17 +0200

apache2 (2.2.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Notable changes:
    - mod_proxy_http: Better handling of excessive interim responses from
      origin server to prevent potential denial of service and high memory
      usage (CVE-2008-2364).
    - mod_proxy_balancer: Prevent CSRF attacks against the balancer-manager
      (CVE-2007-6420).
    - Worker / Event MPM: Fix race condition in pool recycling that leads to
      segmentation faults under load. (Closes: #484800)
    - mod_proxy: Keep connections to the backend persistent in the HTTPS case.
    - mod_proxy: Support environment variable interpolation in reverse
      proxying directives.
    - mod_headers: Add 'merge' option to avoid duplicate values within the
      same header.
    - mod_substitute: The default is now flattening the buckets after each
      substitution. The newly added 'q' flag allows for the quicker, more
      efficient bucket-splitting.
  * Shorten the init script's waiting period during 'restart' from 10 to 4
    seconds. This should still be plenty to allow the apache processes to
    close their listening sockets. Make the wait even shorter if apache dies
    faster. (Closes: #479136)
  * Fix some lintian warnings:
    - Add some missing patch descriptions.
    - Point to /usr/share/common-licenses instead of including the license in
      the copyright file.

apache2 (2.2.8-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replace a2{en,dis}{mod,site} by a rewritten version that
    - supports wildcards (Closes: #373969).
    - can be influenced with environment variables (Closes: #349716).
    - checks existing symlinks for correctness (Closes: #409970).
    - allows to remove dead symlinks (Closes: #480893).
  * Move suexec suid helper program to a separate package apache2-suexec,
    which is not installed by default. Provide an alternative version of
    suexec, which can be customized with a config file. This can be found in
    the apache2-suexec-custom package. Closes: #312252, #266835
  * Some more suexec fixes:
    - Fix race condition when changing directories.
    - Accept only /var/www/*, and not /var/www*. The same for public_html/*
      instead of public_html* (CVE-2007-1742).
    - Raise the minimum userid that suexec may change to from 100 to 1000.
  * Enable mod_deflate in new installs.
  * Include config.nice in apache2-src. This hopefully allows apache2-mpm-itk
    to drop the build-dependency on apache2-prefork-dev.
  * Mention environment variables in apache2 and apache2ctl man pages and point
    to README.Debian. (Closes: #475150)
  * Drop unneeded build-dep on libtool.
  * Drop obsolete apache2-mpm-perchild package (closes: #477522).
  * Don't fail in postinst if there is a dangling symlink /var/www/index.html.
  * Fix typo in bug number in 2.2.8-3 changelog entry.
  * Use dh_lintian in debian/rules.

  * mod_cache: Handle If-Range correctly if the cached resource was stale
    (closes: #470652).
  * mod_autodindex: Use UTF-8 as character set for filenames in the default
    configuration. Change this in autoindex.conf if you are still using
    ISO-8859-1.
  * Introduce APACHE_RUN_DIR and APACHE_LOCK_DIR in apache2ctl. Also, make it
    use APACHE_RUN_USER instead of APACHE2_RUN_USER, to be consistent with
    apache2.conf.
  * Add 'status' function to init script (adapted from patch by Dustin
    Kirkland).
  * Don't build the modules three times. We are only shipping one set of them,
    anyway. (Inspired by the Fedora package.)
  * Remove Fabio M. Di Nitto from the uploaders field (thanks for your work).

  * Add missing ${APACHE_ARGUMENTS} to *) case in apache2ctl.
  * In upgrades from etch, replace /etc/apache2/default without asking also in

apache2 (2.2.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - Fixes cross-site scripting issues in
      o mod_imagemap (CVE-2007-5000)
      o mod_status (CVE-2007-6388)
      o mod_proxy_balancer's balancer manager (CVE-2007-6421)
    - Fixes a denial of service issue in mod_proxy_balancer's balancer manager
      (CVE-2007-6422).
    - Fixes mod_proxy URL encoding in error messages (closes: #337325).
    - Adds explicit charset to the output of various modules to work around
      possible cross-site scripting flaws affecting web browsers that do not
      derive the response character set as required by RFC2616. For
      mod_proxy_ftp there is now the new ProxyFtpDirCharset directive to
      specify something else than ISO-8859-1 (CVE-2008-0005).
    - Adds mod_substitute which performs inline response content pattern
      matching (including regex) and substitution (like mod_line_edit).
    - Adds "DefaultType none" option.
    - Adds new "B" option to RewriteRule to suppress URL unescaping.
    - Adds an "if" directive for mod_include to test whether an URL is
      accessible, and if so, conditionally display content.
    - Adds support for mod_ssl to the event MPM.
  * Move the configuration of User, Group, and PidFile to
    /etc/apache2/envvars. This makes it easier to use these settings in
    scripts. /etc/apache2/envvars can now also be used to influence apache2ctl
    (inspired by Marc Haber's patch).  (Closes: #349709, #460105, #458085)
  * Make apache2ctl check the configuration syntax before trying to restart
    apache, to match the behaviour documented in the man page.
    (Closes: #459236)
  * Convert docs to be directly viewable with a browser (and not use content
    negotiation).
  * Add doc-base entry for the documentation. (closes: #311269)
  * Don't ship default files in /var/www, but copy a sample file to
    /var/www/index.html on new installs. Also remove the now unneeded
    RedirectMatch line from sites-available/default.
    (Closes: #411774, #458093)
  * Add some information to README.Debian (Apache wiki, default virtual host)
  * Build with LDFLAGS=-Wl,--as-needed to drop a lot of unnecessary
    dependencies, easing library transitions (closes: #458857).
  * Add icons for OpenDocuments, add sharutils to Build-Depends for uudecode.
    Patch by Nicolas Valcárcel. (Closes: #436441)
  * Add reportbug script to list enabled modules.
  * Fix some lintian warnings:
    - Pass --no-start to dh_installinit instead of omitting the debhelper token
      in various maintainer scripts. Also move the update-rc.d call to
      apache2.2-common.
    - Add Short-Description to init script.
  * Remove unused apache2-mpm-prefork.prerm from source package and clean up
    debian/rules a bit.
  * Don't ship NEWS.Debian with apache2-utils, as the contents are only
    relevant for the server.

  * Clean up our use of trailing slashes on directories in debian/rules, so
    the newer, pickier, obviously very improved coreutils doesn't bite us.
  * Remove some cruft from apache2-common's postinst, dealing with upgrade
    scenarios from versions older than those released in Sarge or Warty.

  * New upstream release
    - Remove 036_HEAD_CAN-2004-0942, integrated upstream
    - Remove 037_HEAD_CAN-2004-0885, integrated upstream
  * Drop support for the threadpool MPM, as it's abandoned upstream.
    - Make apache2-mpm-threadpool an empty package depending on
      apache2-mpm-worker, and make worker replace the old threadpool
  * Make SYSCONFDIR configurable at the top of a2{en,dis}{mod,site}
  * Drop the build-conflict on gawk, and use ac_cv_prog_AWK=mawk
    instead (closes: #283396)
  * Make the apache_stop() function stop trying to do the equivalent
    of "killall apache2", and instead issue a nasty warning if it can't
    stop apache2 on its own
  * Make "restart" an alias for "force-reload" in the init script, as
    apache2ctl restart doesn't match policy's requirements for restart
  * Swapping between threaded and unthreaded MPMs could leave one with
    both mod_cgi and mod_cgid enabled.  Fixed the postinsts so that
    no longer happens
  * Update 021-pcre_mangle_symbols.patch from Andres Salomon, now also
    mangling typedefs, which should fix PHP (closes: #280823)
  * Hardcode a dependency on libgcc1 (>= 1:3.3.5) so pthread_cancel
    will work correctly with partial upgrades (closes: #287033)
  * When removing ssl_scache, make sure to remove its db transation logs
    and other garbage as well (closes: #293831)
  * Remove duplicate /icons/ from the default site (closes: #291856)
  * Yank 039_fix_forensic_tmpfiles from Ubuntu's apache2 packages

  * Make the MPM postinsts scream loudly, but not fail, if you've
    deleted cgi{,d}.load before swapping MPMs (closes: #283141)

    the cause of the "can't purge with broken config" bugs and fixed that
    too with yet another ||true (closes: #263511, #273759, #279875)

apache2 (2.0.52-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Include two patches, 036_HEAD_CAN-2004-0942 and 037_HEAD_CAN-2004-0885
    - CAN-2004-0942: Memory leak in header parsing in server/protocol.c
    - CAN-2004-0885: Incorrect SSLCipherSuite selection in mod_ssl
  * Fix up our use of netstat in apache2-common's postinst to clean up some
    unnecessary output to stderr, as well as detect when netstat believes
    we don't have AF_INET support.  This should allow for installation in
    chroots where the /proc filesystem isn't mounted (closes: #245487)
  * Add 035_HEAD_Content-Length_Fix_From_CVS, which should solve problems
    with Content-Length being set incorrectly on proxied HEAD requests,
    breaking Windows Update from proxied machines (closes: #277787)
  * Take out the reload/start magic in the postinst, and just call start in
    all cases, as we stop the daemon in the prerm (closes: #275175, #222786)
  * Copy config.guess/config.sub/ltmain.sh in from /usr/share/libtool at
    build time. (closes: #257228, #263101)
  * Clean up the clean target in debian/rules to remove some duplicate
    maintainer scripts from the debian/ directory that we don't need to be
    shipping in the source package.
  * Move envvars to /etc/apache2/ and add patch 038_no_LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
    remove the extraneous LD_LIBRARY_PATH from envvars (closes: #276670)

apache2 (2.0.52-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream bugfix/security release:
    - Fixes CAN-2004-0811: Satisfy directive bypass (closes: #273412)
  * Add '|| true' to a2enmod to stop it from dying when the installed MPM
    isn't prefork (closes: #273017, #273019, #272865, #273021, #273258)
  * Touch /var/log/apache2/error.log on new installs to ensure that our log
    directory isn't removed until the package is purged, so logrotate doesn't
    complain about its inability to find it (closes: #239571)
  * Add 032_suexec_is_shared, which makes sure suEXEC is only searched for
    and enabled when mod_suexec is loaded (closes: #227653)
  * Use '$APACHE2CTL startssl' consistently in init script to make sure the
    SSL define doesn't disappear on force-reload (closes: #272531)
  * Add 033_dbm_read_hash_or_btree to allow apr-util and dbmmanage to open
    and manipulate DB_BTREE databases, while still defaulting to creating
    DB_HASH databases as before.  This should clear up incompatibilities
    with other applications (such as PHP) which default to DB_BTREE.
  * Moved dbmmanage2 to /usr/bin, instead of /usr/sbin, as it's a user tool.
  * Added 034_ab2_has_openssl, thanks to 2.1-cvs, Fedora, thom, and a bit
    of munging, to compile a working ab2 with SSL support (closes: #261820)

apache2 (2.0.51-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Test for the existence of /usr/sbin/apache2 before we go trying to invoke
    it to determine what MPM we have installed (closes: #272103, #272207)
  * Make the default httpd.conf created in apache2-common's postinst contain
    a fake LoadModule line (commented out), and make apxs2 default to
    installing modules to /etc/apache2/httpd.conf, so people using apxs2
    rather than the mods-{enabled,available} directories get the expected
    behaviour, rather than obscure errors (closes: #167552, #231134)
  * apxs2 now writes the correct path to modules in httpd.conf, including
    the mysteriously missing slash (closes: #231450, #167557)
  * Make apxs2 install modules with mode 644, since 755 makes no sense.
  * Added a bit of magic to a2{en,dis}site to treat the default site as a
    special case and add a "000-" priority to the beginning of its symlink.
    Patches welcome to turn this into something robust, like update-rc.d.

apache2 (2.0.51-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release, including the following security fixes:

    - CAN-2004-0786: apr_uri_parse segfault in memcpy
    - CAN-2004-0809: mod_dav crash/DoS via NULL pointer dereference
  * Drop the following patches which are now included upstream:
    - 025_CAN-2004-0748.patch
    - 026_CAN-2004-0751.patch
    - 027_autoindex_ignore_bad_files.patch
    - 028_apr_sticky_bits.patch
  * Install a properly sanitised config_vars.mk so that apxs2 behaves in
    a reasonably sane way (closes: #243340, #270768)
  * Relax www-browser dependency to a Suggests, as the mod_status dump from
    apache2ctl is a pretty minor (and oft unused) feature (closes: #269309)
  * init script now allows you to stop (but not start, restart, etc) the web
    server, even if NO_START is set to 1 (closes: #269398)
  * Make the apache2 -> apache2-mpm-* dependency tighter, so it does what
    one expects when installing it (closes: #269580)
  * Remove the ^/doc/apache2-doc/manual(.*)$ /manual$1 RedirectMatch from
    the default site which was confusing and useless (closes: #270216)
  * Add debian/watch file to track upstream versions.
  * Add some magic to a2enmod to map cgi to cgid if using a threaded MPM.
  * Add a2ensite and a2dissite which do the same thing as a2{en,dis}mod,
    but for sites rather than modules (closes: #269251)

apache2 (2.0.50-12) unstable; urgency=high

  * Build-depend on mawk, and build-conflict with gawk, as we're only
    guaranteed of having one or the other installed at any given time
    and GNU awk seems to royally mess up the build with regards to which
    external symbols get exported by httpd (closes: #268155)
  * Add myself to the Uploaders field as it seems that, for better or
    worse, I have become a co-maintainer of apache2.
  * Drop the :80 from the default site config, so changing ports in
    ports.conf now Just Works (closes: #253271)
  * Added 029_docroot_manual.patch, which corrects the links in the start
    page to point to /manual/ instead of manual/, so the link actually
    works when apache2-doc is installed (closes: #232954)
  * Add a postrm to apache2-common, implementing a policy-compliant purge
    process (closes: #237030, #252254, #197986)
  * Add a simple RedirectMatch to the "default" site, so that fresh
    installations see the default start page, rather than a directory
    listing (closes: #240772, #255974, #264070)
  * Add 030_www-browser_apachectl.patch, and make apache2-common depend
    on www-browser, so 'apache2ctl status' works (closes: #266724)
  * Move apache2's (re)start from the apache2-common postinst to the MPM
    postinsts, so we're not trying to start the old binary if apache2-common
    is configured before apache2-mpm-* is unpacked (closes: #268936)
  * Enable CGI on initial installation, as packages depending on httpd-cgi
    require it to be running to work (closes: #267547, #263038)
  * Only enable userdir on upgrades from older versions where it was
    built-in, or on fresh installs.

apache2 (2.0.50-11) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add two patches from upstream to address two vulnerabilities in mod_ssl:
    - CAN-2004-0748 is a potential infinite loop in the SSL input filter
      which can be triggered by an aborted connection.
    - CAN-2004-0751 is a potential segfault in the SSL input filter which
      can be triggered by the response to request which is proxied to a
      remote SSL server.
  * Changed the ownership of /var/cache/apache2 to allow mod_proxy to
    actually cache files (closes: #264622)
  * Added a patch from upstream to make mod_autoindex skip over files that
    it can't stat() (closes: #264645)
  * New installations now get an /etc/default/apache2 file with a moderately
    informative comment, and the default set sanely (closes: #263515)
  * Added a patch from upstream to make APR stop creating directories with
    the sticky bit set (closes: #266198)
  * Remove the bogus "-e" from the echo that creates httpd.conf, so people
    installing with ash/dash don't get a broken file (closes: #267693)

  * Enable LFS properly. (Closes: #264645, #244897)
    - Added 023_largefiles_upstream_fixes which makes the upstream configure
      script a bit smarter and fixes some misuses of size_t/off_t.
    - Added 024_largefiles_debian_hacks which adds some hideous hackery to
      work around a bug in glibc where sendfile64 is used in place of sendfile
      with no fallback even if the current kernel doesn't support it.
    - Add note to README.Debian noting that while we can now read, write, and
      list large files, SERVING large files is kernel-dependant.
  * Bump libapr0 shlibs to (>= 2.0.50-9), since we're introducing
    some serious ABI breakage with the above changes.
  * Fix up the PATH in apache2's init script to list /usr/local, /usr, /
    in the standard order.
  * Change misleading return messages for a2{en,dis}mod, to reflect
    the reality that some modules just won't load/unload properly
    without a full stop/start server cycle.

  * debian/patches/004a_srclib_layout_support:
    - Updated a touch to fit in with .32-dev.
  * debian/patches/008_stuff_in_sbin_not_bin:
    - Removed; obsoleted by upstream discovering sanity.
  * debian/patches/008_apr-config_sucks:
    - Fix problem whereby @prefix@ would sub to $(prefix), but $(prefix)
      wouldn't sub to the prefix, or ${prefix}, thus screwing up the running
      of apr-config ... ditto for apu-config (from apr-util).
  * debian/patches/009_apxs:
    - Reworked to make it actually work, and apply cleanly.
    - Fix libtool breakage once again, thanks David Kimdon.
  * debian/patches/010_shmget:
    - Hack to srclib/apr/apr.h.in to make it prefer shmget over everything
      else, to make it 2.2/non-tmpfs safe. (Thanks Ben Collins).
  * debian/patches/012_debian_version:
    - Minor update (include a space in front of "Debian", change it to
      "Debian GNU/Linux" to clarify things, and before the the Hurd [happy
      now, you crack junkies?] people complain, it's not released as a Debian
      port yet, so feh).
  * debian/vhost-base/add.d/apache2:
    - Change sites to sites-available, in line with the previous change.
  * debian/config/mods-available:
    - Move to debian/config-mods to make life easier with the move to
      apache2-modules (see below).
  * debian/config-mods/auth_dbm.load:
    - New file, in line with introducing mod_auth_dbm; thanks again to David
      Kimdon.
  * debian/a2-scripts/a2{en,dis}mod:
    - Rewritten to be much cleaner and cool. (Thanks to Ben Collins for
      pointing out that the permissions were screwed).
  * debian/apache2.postinst:
    - New file, no #DEBHELPER# token so that we don't care if postinst fails;
      this way it won't bail if you're already running another web server.
      Thanks to David Kimdon for pointing out an error.
  * debian/vhost-base/{enable,disable}.d/apache2:
    - Fixed! Woot! The code isn't the best you'll see, but now *WORKS*. Whoo!
  * debian/control:
    - Extend libapr-dev's Depends to include libapr0 (duh).
    - Remove apache2-modules-dev as modules are no longer built both shared
      and static, IMHO this was quite braindead behavior. Upstream's change,
      not mine.
    - Remove apache2-support as apxs2 requred apache2 anyway. Chalk one (more)
      down for "failed experiments".
    - Removed redundant libssl0.9.6 and libxmltok1 build-deps; we already
      build-depped on the relevant -dev packages; thanks Ben Collins.
  * debian/rules:
    - Modules are no longer built statically as well as dynamically (upstream
      change), so stop trying to move the files around.
    - Sort out the libapr0/libapr-dev mess once and for all; thanks to Matt
      Wilcox and Ben Collins for patiently talking me through it.
    - Move *contents* of mods-available to apache2-modules, but keep the
      directory itself as part of apache2, to keep the addons happy; thanks
      David Kimdon.
    - s/apache2-support/apache2/, see debian/control entry.
    - Remove extraneous LICENSE file from the vhost manual.
    - Remove *.exp files, because they're unneeded.
  * debian/apache2.docs:
    - Remove KEYS from the list of docs because this is crap and no longer
      distributed. w00t!

apache2 (2.0.28-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enabled mod_auth_dbm for Subversion. (thanks David Kimdon).

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel@sfarc.net>  Thu, 29 Nov 2001 23:25:53 +1100

apache2 (2.0.28-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed up a couple of things,
    /etc/apache2/modules->/etc/apache2/mods-available, etc.
  * Included mod_dav, so Subversion can be built.
  * New package: apache2-modules-dev, containing all
    /usr/lib/apache2/modules/*a. (Thanks Adam Heath).
  * Moved libapr.so.* symlinks to libapr-dev (Thanks again to doogie).

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel@sfarc.net>  Sun, 25 Nov 2001 19:00:19 +1100

apache2 (2.0.28-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to 2.0.28, which they actually managed to agree on calling a beta.
  * debian/apache2.init.d:
    - Stripped of almost all its functionality. Now just touches httpd.conf if
      we're starting and it doesn't exist, and then calls apache2ctl with all
      our options, whatever they may be - it can error out if it wants.
  * Removed patches:
    - 010_index.html.it_typo - merged upstream.
  * Updated patches:
    - 009_apxs: make it actually find libtool. Thanks to David Kimdon.
    - 002_apache2ctl: really fix apache2ctl graceful.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel@sfarc.net>  Sun, 18 Nov 2001 15:29:43 +1100

apache2 (2.0.26+cvs.20011028-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added vhost-base support. 
    - Removed Debconfage and moved all the templates to
      debian/vhost-base/templates.d (/etc/vhosts/templates.d).
      Removed apache2.postinst and apache2.config.
    - Removed a2{dis,en}host.
  * /usr/lib/cgi-bin will now be /cgi-bin, /var/vhosts/hostname/cgi-bin will be
    /cgi-local.

apache2 (2.0.26+cvs.20011028-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Resync with HEAD (another coming to fix segfaults, but no net connectivity
    at the moment - 4-11-2001, 2:12pm. Grrr).
  * New patches:
    - 011_mod_autoindex-symlink: make icons for symlinks to files and dirs 
                                 special cases.
      + Touches modules/generators/mod_autoindex.c
      + Special cases: ^^SYMDIR^^ and ^^SYMLINK^^.
    - 012_debian_version: adds "Debian" to the Apache version string.
      + Touches include/ap_release.h - this patch has *no* context. Please
        don't give it any, I don't want to have to rediff every version.
  * debian/config/httpd.conf, debian/config/apache2.conf:
    - Move main config file to apache2.conf, made it much more bare-bones.
      + User (or package) config should be done in httpd.conf.
  * apache2.conf:
    - s/Port/Listen/ - booya! Finally they cleaned it up.
    - Add (commented-out) icon entries for ^^SYMDIR^^ and ^^SYMLINK^^.
      Anyone volunteer to create icons?
  * debian/apache2.postinst:
    - Minor cleanups.
    - And later: Made it just call ap2addhost --default. (and a2enhost).
  * debian/config/modules/ssl.conf, debian/config/sites/default-443:
    - Put only generic SSL stuff in ssl.conf, split SSL support out into
      a new virtual host thingy in accordance with dealing with ports.
  * debian/config/sites/default, debian/config/sites/default-443,
    debian/patches/004b_debian_layout:
    - Add a new alias /cgi-pub/ to /usr/lib/cgi-bin. Packages should put
      scripts here.
  * debian/control: 
    - changed the Suggests: on apache2-doc to a Recommends:
      + otherwise /manual/ will be a broken alias, as it points to 
        /usr/share/doc/apache2-doc/manual.
    - changed libapr-dev to Architecture: all (from Arch: any) - whoops.
  * Added support for multiple ports on the one virtual host. At the moment
    it's one gigantic, ugly, kludge. *sigh*. Format:
    - /var/vhosts/site.name/htdocs-PORT
    - /var/vhosts/site.name/logs/(access|error).log-PORT
    - /var/vhosts/site.name/cgi-bin-PORT
  * debian/apache2.postinst, debian/config/sites/default, etc:
    - s#/var/www#/var/vhosts#;
    - s#htdocs#htdocs-$PORT#;
  * More Debconfage - it now asks if you want SSL support in the default
    virtual host, and which port number you want (default 81 so it sits
    side-by-side with apache).
  * Major change to postinst, a2addhost, et al:
    - It's all now done in Perl, and postinst is no longer a special case.
      The standalones call Debconf for what they need to do, calling it as a
      standalone. This way, postinst just calls a2addhost, etc, and it also
      smooths the path for me to do the vhost-base stuff.
  * No, this migration path probably won't be smooth (between apache2
    versions). Sorry.
  * Last release before I make it vhost-base compliant.

apache2 (2.0.26+cvs.20011023-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Damnit, resync with HEAD (2_0_26 was unstable). 

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel@sfarc.net>  Tue, 23 Oct 2001 18:36:42 +1000

apache2 (2.0.26-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Resync with upstream CVS (but only as far as the APACHE_2_0_26 tag).
    Essentially, this gives all the coolness of a CVS tree, but all the
    stability of a release. I may start tracking HEAD later, we'll just
    have to see.
  * Changed libapr->libapr0.
  * Fixed a couple of typo's in index.html.it (thanks Md, via Joey).
  * 22nd October, 7:51pm: Resync again as they added a couple of files
    and bumped the tag to fix segfaults.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel@sfarc.net>  Wed, 17 Oct 2001 23:50:39 +1000

apache2 (2.0.25+cvs.20011001-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * More CVS resyncing joy.
  * Silly stupid evil poo bum hack to apachectl. I don't like this.
    Please, help.
  * Got rid of a few lintian warnings.
  * Install build stuff to /etc/apache2/build, adjust apxs accordingly.
  * Agreed on policy with madduck. This is a MAJOR CHANGE, people.
    A lot of stuff has changed around, so you'll need to change your
    packages.
    apache2 now treats everything as a virtual host (even when you only
    have one host). This allows us to skirt around FHS and do our own
    thing. ("Thpthpthpthpthpthpt, we're using vhosts. FHS doesn't say
    anything about that.")
    Please see README.Debian for more details.
  * More fun with virtual hosts. Migrated their configuration files to
    /etc/apache2/virtuals/<name>. This will allow for easy adding and
    removal, via the new tools /usr/sbin/ap2(add|del)vh.
    apache2's postinst touches /etc/apache2/POSTINST_CONFED, and will refuse
    to re-run the postinst config stuff if it's there already.
  * Module fun - /usr/sbin/ap2mod(en|dis). Modules put their loading line in
    /etc/apache2/modules/foo.load, config in /etc/apache2/modules/foo.conf.
    Enabled module stuff gets symlinked into /etc/apache2/mods-enabled.
  * Move APR stuff to /usr/lib, not /usr/lib/libapr. Whoops, should've done
    this a *long* *time* *ago*.
  * More silly APR hacks: Move /usr/include/libapr to /usr/include/apache2, as
    silly things like php4 don't get the fact that APR and apache2 can indeed
    have different include directories. Grrr.
  * Juggled script names - it's now a2(en|dis)(host|mod).
  * I don't care, I'm uploading. No, really (closes: #103471).
    It's been 93 days since I first did dh_make and ITPed it. :)

apache2 (2.0.25+cvs.20010923-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another resync with upstream CVS; most of the changes below were made
    between then and now.
  * Also added apache2-support - everything from support/*, so php4, et al
    don't need to Build-Depend on apache2 itself.

 -- Daniel Stone <DanielS@esd.nec.com.au>  Sun, 23 Sep 2001 13:21:16 +1000

apache2 (2.0.25+cvs.20010908-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Synched everything with CVS; it works now. 
  * We now build with ./buildconf due to the above; redo all the patches
    against configure.in. I swear this will be the last change, and that I'll
    test it.
  * Removed php4 and modperl-2.0 from the tree. I should keep the changelogs 
    internal, as this is now getting not only very silly, but very embarassing.
  * I corrected myself in the ITP that it was licensed under the Apache
    Software License, not GPLed, but forgot to do that in debian/copyright.
    Whoops. Feel free to LART.
  * Lintian cleanups:
  	- Remove extra LICENSE files.
  	- Stop stuff calling -rpath.
  	- Change printenv to call /usr/bin/perl, not /usr/local/bin/perl - wtf?
  	- Move manpages to the right directory.
  * Minor merge from Thom courtesy of some stuff being stored on pandora:~thom.
    - Use buildprogs.pl to parse stuff like apache2ctl, apxs2, etc.
  * Hopefully I'm only one CVS sync away from an upload.
  * Moved some stuff over to /usr/sbin, fixed apache2ctl once and for all.
    Hopefully.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel@sfarc.net>  Sun,  9 Sep 2001 00:05:03 +1000

apache2 (2.0.24-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Farewell Buddha" Release.
  * Or, alternatively: The "Darren Milburn is an Idiot for Inciting Crowds"
    Release.
  * Yes, it's the height of evil, I know: modperl-2.0 goes into the source 
    tree. (from CVS).
    Separate tarballs, thanks to DBS, but still, yeah.
  * Ditto php4.
  * Still no Thom's laptop; hence no merges, and I'm not going to duplicate
    work. 

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel@sfarc.net>  Sun,  2 Sep 2001 21:50:59 +1000

apache2 (2.0.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Use prefork, not threaded, MPM. (threaded is currently broken).
  * Update example httpd.conf for mod_ssl and have lines for all the modules. 
  * Build-Depends, all the Build-Depends!
  * Update maintainer email address (thanks Joey).
  * Turns out using buildconf was what broke modules. I swear I won't do
    anything like that again. Promise! (thanks Thom for pointing this out)
  * Implied by the above, rediff all patches against configure, not 
    configure.in.
  * Also, don't copy configure.{guess,sub} over anymore, because we don't need
    them.
  * More Thom merges:
    - debian/patches/003_apache2ctl - rewritten apache2ctl to actually work.
  * Return of debian/patches/006_dont_install_build_crap. GAH!

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel@sfarc.net>  Sat, 18 Aug 2001 17:01:19 +1000

apache2 (2.0.23-2) unstable; urgency=low
  * SSL finally works, and beat instructions on how to get it going out
    of someone on new-httpd. Moved SSL stuff to apache2-modules. 
  * Disabled TLS, because it's unstable and unnecessary.
  * Merge from Thom May's tree:
      005b_debian_layout - The Debian layout for stuff
    - Move APR stuff to /usr/lib/libapr and /usr/include/libapr.
    - Clean up debian/rules, largely thanks to the two new patches.
  * General cleanups, resulting from running lintian:
    - Chuck #DEBHELPER# in postinst, which also fixes the /usr/doc
      and init.d problems (due to debhelper now doing its postinst
      thing).
    - Remove LICENSE files from apache2-doc and the default document
      root.
    - Remove man/ and build/ top-level dirs, install manpages correctly.
    - Updated 004_perl_in_usr_bin to include the manual search CGI.
  * Remove all evil, ugly, patches to configure in debian/patches/*, instead,
    diff against configure.in, because autoconf gets run in the configure
    stage every time.
  * Copy config.{guess,sub} from /usr/share/misc (provided by autotools-dev) at
    runtime, thus eliminating debian/patches/002_config_guess_and_sub.
  * Reshuffled patch numbers to cope with the above.
  * I give up on this DBM crap. Disable mod_auth_dbm for now.

apache2 (2.0.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream - 2.0.23.
  * New patches:
    004_conffile_in_etc_apache2 - Make an ugly init.d hack unnecessary.
    005_perl_in_usr_bin - Make example CGI scripts use /usr/bin/perl.
  * Fix mime_magic stuff by copying magic to /etc/apache2. 
  * Remove debian/patches/003_cgisock_in_var_log_apache2, instead found a new
    conffile directive, put this into the default distributed conffile.
