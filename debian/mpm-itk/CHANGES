apache2.2-mpm-itk 2.2.17-01, released 2011-03-21:

  * Fixed CVE-2011-1176: If NiceValue was set, the default with no
    AssignUserID was to run as root:root instead of the default Apache user
    and group, due to the configuration merger having an incorrect default
    configuration.
  * Rebase against Apache 2.2.17.
  * Fix an issue where users can sometimes get spurious 403s on persistent
    connections, if the .htaccess files are not world readable.
  * In the config merger, don't reallocate the username, since it's already
    in the correct pool. (This is not a memory leak, only a small inefficiency.)

apache2.2-mpm-itk 2.2.11-02, released 2009-04-14:

  * Really fix the waitpid() code; thanks to Dave Cundiff for spotting the typo.
  * Add CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH to the list of capabilities, so Apache can read
    .htaccess files that are not world readable. This should fix some of the
    "permission denied" problems that cropped up in 2.2.11-01, although you
    will still see the problem if you use root-squashed NFS.

apache2.2-mpm-itk 2.2.11-01, released 2009-03-21:

  * NOTE: This release contains major new functionality. As with mpm-itk in
    general, you may want to consider closely whether you actually want to
    put it in production. Also note that Apache 2.0 is no longer supported.
  * Updated for Apache 2.2.11 (in particular, prefork had a few minor changes
    that are now incorporated).
  * Allow uid/gid and nice value to be set per-directory (actually per-location)
    in addition to per-vhost. Adapted from patch by Knut Auvor Grythe.
  * Some minor code cleanups.
  * If waitpid() is interrupted by a signal (returning EINTR), try again.
    This fixes a race condition where a graceful restart could fail and hang
    the child forever. Adapted from patch by Jan Boysen, who also diagnosed and
    reported the bug.
  * As a side effect of the per-directory patches doing proper config merging,
    you can now set default values for all options outside the vhost definitions
    and have them get properly overridden by settings in more specific scopes.
  * Fix a small memory leak on reload by using apr_pstrdup() instead of
    strdup().

apache2.2-mpm-itk 2.2.6-02, released 2008-07-27:

  * Fix a typo in the autoconf snippet that would prevent building with
    capability dropping support. Note that you'll need to run autoheader before
    autoconf to get -lcap detected (the Debian/Ubuntu packages was missing
    this, so others might as well).

apache2.2-mpm-itk 2.2.6-01, released 2008-01-05:

  * Updated 01-copy-prefork.patch to let prefork.c come from Apache 2.2.6
    instead of 2.2.3. Updated all the patches so they apply cleanly
    afterwards. In other words, there is no mpm-itk-specific functionality
    in this release, it's only a maintenance release against the latest
    Apache.
  * Removed a few instances of trailing whitespace in the patches.
  * Added this changelog.
