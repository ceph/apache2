.SH NAME
suexec \- Switch User For Exec
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B suexec -V
.PP
This is a customized version that can be configured with
config files in /etc/apache2/suexec.
.PP
No other synopsis for usage, because this program
is otherwise only used internally by the Apache HTTP server.
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B suexec
is the "wrapper" support program for the suexec behaviour for the
Apache HTTP server.  It is run from within the server automatically
to switch the user when an external program has to be run under a
different user. For more information about suexec in general, see the online
document `Apache suexec Support' on the HTTP server project's
Web site at  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/suexec.html .
.PP
This version of suexec reads a config file on every execution. Therefore
it is a bit slower than the standard suexec version from the apache2-suexec
package.
.SH CONFIGURATION
If suexec is called by a user with name 'username', it will look into
/etc/apache2/suexec/username for configuration. If the file does not exist,
suexec will abort. By creating several config files, you can allow several
different apache run users to use suexec.
.PP
The first line in the file is used as the document root (/var/www in the
standard suexec) and the second line in the file is used as the suffix that is
appended to users' home directories (public_html in standard suexec).
.PP
If any of the lines is commented out (with #), suexec will refuse the
corresponding type of request. It is recommended to comment out the 
userdir suffix if you don't need it.
.SH SECURITY
Do not set the document root to a path that includes users' home directories
(like /home or /var) or directories where users can mount removable media.
Doing so would create local security issues. Suexec does not allow to set the
document root to the root directory / .
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -V
Display the list of compile-time settings used when \fBsuexec\fP
was built.  No other action is taken.
